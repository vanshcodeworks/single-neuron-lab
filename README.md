The Interactive Neuron Lab

An interactive, web-based tool for visualizing how a single neuron learns using the gradient descent algorithm. This project is designed to make the core concepts of machine learning accessible and intuitive for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

Users can switch between regression and classification tasks, input their own custom data, tune parameters like weight, bias, and learning rate, and watch the neuron adapt in real-time.
‚ú® Key Features

    Dual Modes: Seamlessly switch between Regression (predicting continuous values) and Classification (predicting binary categories).

    Custom Data Input: Enter up to five of your own data points to see how the neuron handles different datasets.

    Live Visualization: A dynamic D3.js chart plots your data and shows the regression line or decision boundary updating with each training step.

    Animated Neuron Diagram: A live diagram illustrates the inner workings of the neuron, showing how x, w, and b combine to produce the prediction ≈∑.

    Interactive Controls: Manually step through the training process or let it run automatically. Adjust the initial weight, bias, and learning rate to see their immediate impact.

    Real-Time Metrics: Key metrics like Epoch, Loss, Weight, and Bias are updated live, providing instant feedback on the learning process.

    In-Depth Explanations: A built-in, expandable section explains the core mathematical concepts (Forward Pass, Loss Function, Gradient Descent) in simple, easy-to-understand terms with formulas rendered using KaTeX.

    Fully Responsive: A clean, modern UI that works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
